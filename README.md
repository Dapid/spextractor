SPEXTRACTOR

This code takes a spectrum, smoothes it using Gaussian processes and returns pseudo equivalent widths 
and velocities for 7 features of a Ia spectrum. If one is interested in other features it is easy to change those in the code. See example for use of the code. 

Installation:

```
git clone https://github.com/astrobarn/spextractor.git
cd spextractor
pip install .
```
